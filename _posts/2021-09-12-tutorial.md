Ockham is a content-first minimalist Jekyll blog theme.

Ockham doesn't offer a bunch of fancy frills and complicated functions to take away from your focus on **writing**, but Ockham does offer some basic features, including a hideable *sidebar*, a *light and dark mode* that follows the system settings, configurable page *navigation* and *social links*, *pagination*, *analytics*, a *comment system*, *archive*, and more.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "ockham"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: ockham
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ockham

If your website is hosted on GitHub Pages, you can install this theme via [`jekyll-remote-theme`](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme).

Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-remote-theme"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
plugins:
  - jekyll-remote-theme
```

Add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
remote_theme: zivong/ockham
```

## Basic Settings

Open the `_config.yml` file in your repo and set some basic properties:

```yml
title:       # Your site title
tagline:     # Your site tagline
description: # Your site description
author:
  name:      # Your name
  url:       # Your URL, e.g. your twitter profile
```

## Layouts

Ockham provides three layouts:

- `home`, which is used in the `index.html` file in your site; it just simply shows post entries.
- `page`, which is for static pages.
- `post`, which is for posts.

## Navigation

You can configure the page navigation by creating a `_data/navigation.yml` file and setting `title` and `url` properties, e.g.

```yml
- title: Home
  url: /
- title: About
  url: /about/
```

## Social Links

You can easily configure social media links, just set `title`, `url`, `icon` in the `_data/social.yml` file; `icon` is a [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) class, e.g.

```yml
- title: Email
  url: mailto:zivong@protonmail.com
  icon: fas fa-envelope
- title: Twitter
  url: https://twitter.com/zivong91
  icon: fab fa-twitter
- title: GitHub
  url: https://github.com/zivong
  icon: fab fa-github
```

## Pagination

Ockham uses `jekyll-paginate` to implement the function of pagination. You can read its [docs](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate) to learn how to use it.

## Google Analytics 4

To enable [Google Analytics 4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681?hl=en), you just need to set the [Measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7372977?hl=en) in your `_config.yml`, for example,

```yml
google_analytics: G-XXXXXXX
```

## Disqus

Ockham uses [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) as the comment system. To enable it, just set `disqus: <your disqus short name>` in the `_config.yml` file.

## Math

Ockham adopts [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) to render math formulas, e.g.

```latex
$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$
```

will be rendered as

$$
i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

By default, MathJax is unable. You can enable it on a page by putting `math: true` in that page.

## Archive

Ockham provides some built-in archive pages. It is implemented in pure Liquid. If you want to archive posts by years, you can create a page and put these code in it:

```yml
---
layout: archive
type: years
---
```

Similarly, if you want to archive posts by categories or tags, you can set the `type` property as `categories` or `tags`.

## Customization

You can of course copy all of Ockham's code into your own repository and modify it however you like, but there is a much cleaner way to customize it; if you just need to modify the style, you can just copy [`_sass/ockham/_variables.scss`](https://github.com/zivong/ockham/blob/master/_sass/ockham/_variables.scss) to the corresponding path in your repository and modify the variables in it.

If you want to put some code such as feed meta or SEO tags into the `<head>` element, just override `_includes/custom-head.html` in your repo.
